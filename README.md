# Structure
* reddit-dailyprogrammer-easy serves as git repository root folder.
* Each solution is stored individually in an adequately named subfolder, as an Eclipse Java Project.
* Within each Eclipse Java Project, the Java output folder /bin is .gitignored. /doc folder is not ignored, for now.
* The repository root contains only two other files; README.md (which you're reading now), and LICENSE.md (which you can find out more about below).

# Other
* All work contained within this repository is released in accordance with [The Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/).
