# Motivation and Goals
To gain practical experience in:
* Environments and Languages: The OpenJDK and it's implementation of Java SE.
* Development Tools: Eclipse (IDE), JUnit (Unit Testing), Git (VCS/SCM), Github (GFM, Project Hosting, Coding Community).
* Methodologies: Object Orientated Programming (OOP), Self-Documenting Code and Javadoc, Test Driven Development (TDD), Algorithm and Data Structure Knowledge and Design.
* Become accustomed to suitable "best practises" in between.

# Structure
* reddit-dailyprogrammer-easy serves as Git repository root folder.
* Each solution is stored individually in an adequately named subfolder, as an Eclipse Java Project.
* Within each Eclipse Java Project, the Java output folder /bin is .gitignored. /doc folder is not ignored, for now.
* The repository root contains only three other files; README.md (which you're reading now), and LICENSE.md (which you can find out more about below), and .gitattributes (to instruct GitHub Linguist to not skew it's code analysis due to generated Javadoc).

# Conventions
* Git commits will be as task specific as possible, as all commits should be!
* Git commit message style in as best as possible accordance from [joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message).

# Other
* All work contained within this repository is released in accordance with [The Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/).
* This may also be read in LICENSE.md. If there's any difference between the two, assume the license found in the link above is in use.
